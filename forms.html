            that what page should it go when user click submit button,
             ex: index.html or google.com . It will go to the mentioned website 
             with the data we entered in the form field.
             We also had to specify by which method we are going to transfer the data.
             This will be done by method attribute in <form> tag.
             Normally the encoding type is UTF-8 which is defined in the character set attribute in the <meta> tag.
             But this encoding type will create some % symbol and some other weird encoding.
             Inorder to prevent the same, we will set the encoding type as text/plain using enctype attribute
             -->
